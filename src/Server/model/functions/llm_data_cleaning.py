    # Prompt for generating receipt JSON
    prompt = '''You are tasked with developing a text processing system to clean raw OCR results of receipts. Your system should focus on extracting specific fields from the receipts and formatting them into a structured JSON format.

The fields to be extracted are:

Shop Information: This refers to the name of the shop from which the receipt originates.
Total: The total bill amount.
Time: The datetime of the transaction.
Item Purchase: This includes a list of items purchased, each with its name, quantity, and price.
Your system should perform the following tasks:

Clean any small errors in the OCR results, such as correcting single-character mistakes.
If the quantity of a product is not explicitly provided but mentioned multiple times, count the number of occurrences to estimate the quantity.
If a field is missing put None.
Format the output into a JSON structure with the following schema:
{{
"Shop_Information": "<Shop name>",
"Total": <Total bill amount>,
"Time": "<Datetime of transaction>",
"Item_purchase": {{
    "<Product name 1>": {{
    "qty": <Quantity>,
    "price": <Price>
    }},
    "<Product name 2>": {{
    "qty": <Quantity>,
    "price": <Price>
    }},
    ...
}}
}}
Your system should be able to handle variations in OCR results and provide consistent and accurate extraction and formatting.

Example Output:

{{
"Shop_Information": "XYZ Store",
"Total": 50.25,
"Time": "2024-03-27 15:45:00",
"Item_purchase": {{
    "Apples": {{
    "qty": 2,
    "price": 5.00
    }},
    "Oranges": {{
    "qty": 3,
    "price": 3.50
    }},
    "Bananas": {{
    "qty": 1,
    "price": 1.25
    }}
}}
}}
Ensure that your system handles various formats and variations in OCR results effectively to provide accurate extraction and formatting.

Here the data to process:
{input_text}
You have to respond in the json format and the json format only without saying anything else'''
